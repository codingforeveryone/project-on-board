**Ask a FACer to join our Gitter channel to keep in touch!**  
After creating a Github account, sign up to Gitter and ask one of us to add you to...  
https://gitter.im/codingforeveryone

### When you arrive:
* Say hi to us! (Look for the founders & coders t-shirts!)
* Find someone of *similar* ability to pair up with
* We recommend running through Codecademy tracks together or running through katas together on Codewars  
* Try swapping who is typing around every 15-20 minutes and talk through what both of you are thinking
* Until next time, we strongly encourage books in the recommended reading below, and equally encourage pairing up to read a chapter or two of these books, then coming back to discuss them

Please find the names of FACers supervising the evening on the whiteboard, along with our Codewars Katas of the week!
